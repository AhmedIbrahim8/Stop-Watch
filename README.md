# Stop-Watch
# Project Description
- ATmega16 Microcontroller with frequency 1Mhz.
- Timer1 in ATmega16 with CTC mode to count the Stop Watch time.
- Six Common Anode 7-segments are used.
- The six 7-segments in the project are connected using the multiplexed technique.
- Only one 7447 decoder is used for all 7-segments and control the enable/disable for each 7-segement using a NPN BJT transistor connect to one of the MCU pins.
